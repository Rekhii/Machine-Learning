# 📊 Data Every Day

A daily practice series where I work on different datasets, apply machine learning techniques, and keep improving my skills in data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.  

Along with weekday data practice, every **Saturday & Sunday** I focus on **fine-tuning large language models (LLMs)** to strengthen my skills in modern NLP and transfer learning.  

The main goal is to **stay consistent, learn by doing, and build a portfolio** that shows real progress.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Practice **data analysis, cleaning, and visualization** every day.  
- Experiment with **ML/DL models** on diverse datasets.  
- Perform **LLM fine-tuning** on weekends (Sat–Sun).  
- Build a **collection of reproducible notebooks** for interviews and learning.  
- Develop the habit of **hands-on problem solving**.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder/day includes:
- **Dataset / Source**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Data Cleaning steps** (sometimes quick or minimal)  
- **Modeling & Evaluation**  
- **Key Learnings**

**Weekend Folders (Sat–Sun):**  
- Fine-tuning experiments with models like **BERT, Qwen, GPT-style models, etc.**  
- Training scripts & configs  
- Evaluation reports  

---

## ⚠️ Note
This repo is about **learning and consistency**.  
Some notebooks may have:
- Rough or rushed cleaning steps.  
- Quick experiments instead of polished code.  
- Areas marked for future improvement.  

The focus is on **showing progress**, not perfection.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Covered
- Data preprocessing (missing values, scaling, encoding)  
- ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, SVMs, Neural Nets, etc.)  
- Deep learning basics (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)  
- **LLM fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT, TRL)**  
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, BLEU, Perplexity)  
- Iterative experimentation (Kaggle-style approach)

---

## 📈 Why It Matters
- Shows **commitment to daily practice**  
- Covers a **wide variety of datasets and problems**  
- Adds **LLM fine-tuning experience** for cutting-edge NLP skills  
- Demonstrates **growth over time**  
- Useful for **interview discussions** on approach and learnings  

---

## 🌟 Future Plans
- Clean up and refine selected projects.  
- Add automated evaluation helpers.  
- Expand fine-tuning to more advanced LLMs.  
- Share selected notebooks as Kaggle kernels or blog posts.
